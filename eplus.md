## Battery Consumption Tests:

- It is expected that the battery power consumption will show a slight decrease, provided that the device is configured properly. For example, turning off the internet connection, closing background apps, and enabling battery-saving mode when going to sleep are good practices. (Those who own a Ginkgo device always follow these measures, right? Or are you an exception?);
- Furthermore, even when the battery reaches 0% charge, the device should still continue to function;
- If you leave the device idle, whether for resting or engaging in other activities that keep the device inactive, every 3 hours, after a series of tests, the battery should decrease by approximately 9%. This estimate is based on my own routine and my device - me, Maki;
- However, if your battery is in poor condition and nearing the end of its lifespan, achieving better performance may be challenging;
- To further optimize battery consumption, it is advisable to consider the use of apps or power management modules or adjust the power-saving settings on your device.

# Extra:
- Do you want the launcher features? Check previous changelog credits.
- Can't apply your gore theme? Try [MIUI MTZ app](google.com)
- Missing any alien string lang? Contact Xiaomi
- You know, it's interesting how/weird people can be quite unpredictable. I've observed comments from users who've invested in other projects, mentioning issues like, "Oh, there are so many bugs," "Bluetooth connectivity problems," and "Frequent soft reboots...". But then, when someone tries out my project, they end up complaining about a frustrating absence of a fucking language option in a MIUI CN-based version and strangely prefer to use a version with known bugs instead. It's something I just can't comprehend.
