# Notes:
## Battery Consumption Tests:

- It is expected that the battery power consumption will show a slight decrease, provided that the device is configured properly. For example, turning off the internet connection, closing background apps, and enabling battery-saving mode when going to sleep are good practices. (Those who own a Ginkgo device always follow these measures, right? Or are you an exception?);

- Furthermore, even when the battery reaches 0% charge, the device should still continue to function;

- If you leave the device idle, whether for resting or engaging in other activities that keep the device inactive, every 3 hours, after a series of tests, the battery should decrease by approximately 9%. This estimate is based on my own routine and my device - me, Maki;

- However, if your battery is in poor condition and nearing the end of its lifespan, achieving better performance may be challenging;

- To further optimize battery consumption, it is advisable to consider the use of apps or power management modules or adjust the power-saving settings on your device.
