# How MIUI Works

It's 2023, and there's some confusion among people regarding how certain MIUI variants operate, such as the requirement for a specific app version to use the "name feature." I won't waste my time on including unnecessary global garbage features, as they serve no purpose. Remember this: MIUI China based sources will always excel for various obvious reasons.

## Some might say:

* "I wish this had support for an alien language." 

When will you take the time to learn basic english or any other language? Language support is an additional feature I've added to this project. Originally, MIUI CN sources didn't offer this. Take the MIUI Theme app, for instance: In Maki.CN, you'll find support for numerous languages. The only elements in chinese are the posts and theme titles that their authors choose to write in the Chinese variant. Once more, I won't clutter the interface with unnecessary global features just to cater to a few missing elements. This is simply how MIUI operates.

Even Xiaomi wouldn't go as far as creating a custom ROM just for you, but I did.

If you're looking for a specific feature like gore, it's easier to switch to a compatible ROM that supports it.

# Personal Notes
- AOD isn't a bug, actually I've removed this useless feature
- I don't care about Theme app, you can update or install the version you want
- When you reboot your device, please be patient and allow some time for the operating system to load. Avoid immediately clicking and opening every app or settings. Remember, MIUI may take a few minutes to run smoothly and efficiently after a restart
- No idea how this build works on Willow, my device is a Ginkgo
- KernelSU compatible (Moe as recommendation - https://t.me/MoeNOfficial for P̶i̶c̶m̶e̶m̶e̶p̶a̶y̶
- If your internet connection comes from the Acre or from a Dinossaur waves or something, I can't help. My internet speed is fine here and I'll keep uploding at the same server no matter what.
- Use any GCam, I don't even care about Mi meme camera
