# Notes:
- When using MIUI China (Maki.CN), it's important to note that you'll need to manually configure notifications and permissions for each individual app, including settings like notifications on the lock screen (Settings > Apps > Permissions). If you find yourself facing this situation, it might be your first experience with MIUI China. I'm pretty sure it's your first time using CN base in your life.
- Regarding notifications, please refer to the previous message as it contains helpful information.
If you're using a modified app like WhatsApp mods or if your battery is running low while restoring meme backups, it's advisable to prioritize charging your battery first. Additionally, remember to manually configure all necessary permissions and notifications.
- If you have any question or need more information, I recommend that you take some time to read the usage documentation for Maki.CN in this repository. Stop asking questions that have already been explicitly included in the notes and learn to read carefully.
- Remember, if you want a specific version of any meme app, just install manually like the gore theme app. Go to [System Updates by Xiaomiui](https://t.me/MiuiSystemUpdates)

## Battery Consumption Tests:

- It is expected that the battery power consumption will show a slight decrease, provided that the device is configured properly. For example, turning off the internet connection, closing background apps, and enabling battery-saving mode when going to sleep are good practices. (Those who own a Ginkgo device always follow these measures, right? Or are you an exception?);
- Furthermore, even when the battery reaches 0% charge, the device should still continue to function;
- If you leave the device idle, whether for resting or engaging in other activities that keep the device inactive, every 3 hours, after a series of tests, the battery should decrease by approximately 9%. This estimate is based on my own routine and my device - me, Maki;
- However, if your battery is in poor condition and nearing the end of its lifespan, achieving better performance may be challenging;
- To further optimize battery consumption, it is advisable to consider the use of apps or power management modules or adjust the power-saving settings on your device.
